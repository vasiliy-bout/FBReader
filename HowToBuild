How to Build for Win32
------------------------

Prerequisites:

1. MS Visual Studio 2008

2. sed package from GNUWin

3. MS Windows with NTFS support for symbolic links

4. NSIS (it's needed if you want to create installation package; see http://nsis.sf.net)

To build:

1. Check the MS Visual Studio 2008 installation directory in the vcvars.bat file

2. Create (or edit) file "makefiles-win32\target.mk"
   In this file you should define 3 variables:
	TARGET_ARCH -- target platform for building FBReader
	UI_TYPE -- UI library
	TARGET_STATUS -- "release", "debug" or "profile". "release" is reasonable choice for almost all users.

   Possible pairs for TARGET_ARCH + UI_TYPE are:
	TARGET_ARCH = win32                 UI_TYPE = win32

3. Check options in the "makefiles-win32\arch\$(TARGET_ARCH).mk"
   This file defines compilers, compilation flags, etc.

4. Run prepare.bat

5. Under the cmd shell:
5.1 run vcvars.bat to setup environment
5.2 run "nmake /f Makefile.win32" to start building process
